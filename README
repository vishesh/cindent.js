cindent-js
==========

cindent-js is a C source code formatter, indenter and beautifier. This is at its
very early stage (not even in working state, while writing this README).

There are many good and mature projects which does this job much better.
However, I couldn't find any one which was based on JavaScript. The reason I was
looking for something in JavaScript was - 

    - It can be used in applications which embed JavaScript engines.
    - I can make a web application which can use this to indent C source code at
      client side, hence removing the overhead at server.

I've previous zero experience with JavaScript and lexical analysis, yet I chose
this only for the sake of being able to put it in web page and people
(particularly my college friends) benefit from it anytime, anywhere.
